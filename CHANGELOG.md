# [4.1.0](https://github.com/BottlecapDave/HomeAssistant-OctopusEnergy/compare/v4.0.0...v4.1.0) (2022-03-22)


### Features

* **sensor:** added info logs to indicate why sensors aren't added ([cc3fbeb](https://github.com/BottlecapDave/HomeAssistant-OctopusEnergy/commit/cc3fbebf413ef18397f604536f867af71a0205a2))

# [4.0.0](https://github.com/BottlecapDave/HomeAssistant-OctopusEnergy/compare/v3.1.0...v4.0.0) (2022-03-07)


### Bug Fixes

* Fixed support for meters that both import and export electricity (Thanks [@696](https://github.com/696)GrocuttT) ([1391dc8](https://github.com/BottlecapDave/HomeAssistant-OctopusEnergy/commit/1391dc83fc23000d434dda70ea8fdd802721ef59))


### Features

* **config:** Updated selecting target meters for target sensors to be more user friendly ([b1dc00f](https://github.com/BottlecapDave/HomeAssistant-OctopusEnergy/commit/b1dc00f49db4a225de2c66317a1e9b45800dc145))
* **sensor:** Added tariff code to electricity and gas consumption sensors ([a728652](https://github.com/BottlecapDave/HomeAssistant-OctopusEnergy/commit/a72865291a18e3d9cb38ecfa3ae7455b4339d216))
* **sensor:** Updated electricity sensors to include is_export attribute ([d35967e](https://github.com/BottlecapDave/HomeAssistant-OctopusEnergy/commit/d35967ed0b51474b4d23111f038bd613147b5e41))
* **sensor:** updated gas sensors to include mprn in name ([af528ef](https://github.com/BottlecapDave/HomeAssistant-OctopusEnergy/commit/af528efa98d99e46675f83fbc7214b960fbf474f))

### BREAKING CHANGES

* **sensor:** This has been updated for consistency with the electricity sensor changes
* Unfortunately in order to support import/exports, electricity sensors now include both the mpan and serial number in their name. This means you will need to update any automations or dashboards that rely on these sensors.

## [3.0.1](https://github.com/BottlecapDave/HomeAssistant-OctopusEnergy/compare/v3.0.0...v3.0.1) (2021-12-23)


### Bug Fixes

* **sensor:** updated tariff code in sensor setup to be retrieved after it's been setup in the rate coordinator ([9caade9](https://github.com/BottlecapDave/HomeAssistant-OctopusEnergy/commit/9caade91eac4ff14a785bc4d5c1ec455ec047bba))

# [3.0.0](https://github.com/BottlecapDave/HomeAssistant-OctopusEnergy/compare/v2.0.0...v3.0.0) (2021-12-22)


### Bug Fixes

* **sensor:** Removed code for falling back on fixed tariffs if no agreement is found ([9a5045b](https://github.com/BottlecapDave/HomeAssistant-OctopusEnergy/commit/9a5045bca5746e6fb289dda1616f795716e9fad1))


### Features

* **sensor:** Added sensors for accumulative cost of gas for the previous day ([42a1408](https://github.com/BottlecapDave/HomeAssistant-OctopusEnergy/commit/42a140827a4fc03694a5cc2d1fcaea31010003b5))

* **sensor:** removed current consumption sensors due to insufficient data provided by Octopus Energy ([0470ff3](https://github.com/BottlecapDave/HomeAssistant-OctopusEnergy/commit/0470ff38c88f1bc480bbe949fed05f4bf16bf57b))
* **sensor:** Removed registering of current consumption sensors ([d263a68](https://github.com/BottlecapDave/HomeAssistant-OctopusEnergy/commit/d263a6889d907506c6f797329e18c7ac14377b75))

### BREAKING CHANGES

* We no longer fall back to fixed rate agreements if an active agreement can't be found. This was
added by mistake when people were not receiving sensors when they had moved home and therefore an
inactive house was being picked up. This means that some sensors may disapper, but these should just
be inactive meters.
* **sensor:** Latest consumption sensors are no longer available, which may cause issues anywhere they are used.

# [2.0.0](https://github.com/BottlecapDave/HomeAssistant-OctopusEnergy/compare/v1.2.0...v2.0.0) (2021-11-10)


### Bug Fixes

### BREAKING CHANGES

* **api-client:** This change could cause the sensors associated with your meters to change, as they may have been
associated with a property you had moved out of

# [1.2.0](https://github.com/BottlecapDave/HomeAssistant-OctopusEnergy/compare/v1.1.0...v1.2.0) (2021-10-30)


### Bug Fixes

* Updated how we determine if we're on an expired fixed tariff ([075766f](https://github.com/BottlecapDave/HomeAssistant-OctopusEnergy/commit/075766f3ece1a021c889ab0032cd807c028e9300))


### Features
