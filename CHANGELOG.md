### BREAKING CHANGES

* all_rates and applicable_rates attributes are no longer accessible in rate sensors. All rate
information is available in the events attribute. See
https://github.com/BottlecapDave/HomeAssistant-OctopusEnergy/discussions/444 for more information
* Any previous references to valid_from/valid_to,
interval_start/interval_end or from/to have now been changed to
start/end. This change may take a little while to propagate while old
data is replaced. Any reliances on these attribute names will need to be
updated.
* The joined events attribute has been removed from the saving session binary sensor in favour of the event entity
* Any references to last_calculated_timestamp attribute should be updated to last_evaluated
* saving session points sensor has been removed in favour of octoplus points sensor
* Any references to saving session entities will need to be updated based on name change including account id
* Any references to intelligent sensors will need to be updated based on name changes including account id
* All references to value_inc_vat and rates are now in pounds/pence. If you are relying on this
structure, you may need to update your logic
* Standing charge attribute on cost sensors are now in pound/pence. If you are using this, then you may
need to adjust any calculations etc.
* Various attributes have been updated to be numeric instead of strings with symbols (e.g. £1.50 -> 1.50). Any
logic that was used to remove these symbols will now break. In addition, some attributes had raw
representations, which have now been removed. Please review docs for more information.

### BREAKING CHANGES

* **api-client:** While this shouldn't have a negative effect on anyone, I'm marking the removal of the tracker
fallback API as a breaking change. This is because I believe it's cause bugs to be raised and there
are several threads within the OE forums that don't suggest using it for various reasons
https://forum.octopus.energy/t/finding-the-latest-gas-tracker-api/6021/9. This original tariff that
introduced this work around is now properly supported by the API.
* **sensor:** These sensors no longer look at the next/previous 30 minute rate so behaviour will change for all
tariffs. This is to make them more useful for non agile tariffs. Attributes of these sensors have
also changed. Please review docs for more information.
* **sensor:** The rates attribute on the previous/current/next rate sensors will now contain the previous days
rates. If you are using this attribute, you may need to adjust your use.

* **sensor:** removed current consumption sensors due to insufficient data provided by Octopus Energy ([0470ff3](https://github.com/BottlecapDave/HomeAssistant-OctopusEnergy/commit/0470ff38c88f1bc480bbe949fed05f4bf16bf57b))
* **sensor:** Removed registering of current consumption sensors ([d263a68](https://github.com/BottlecapDave/HomeAssistant-OctopusEnergy/commit/d263a6889d907506c6f797329e18c7ac14377b75))

### BREAKING CHANGES

* We no longer fall back to fixed rate agreements if an active agreement can't be found. This was
added by mistake when people were not receiving sensors when they had moved home and therefore an
inactive house was being picked up. This means that some sensors may disapper, but these should just
be inactive meters.
* **sensor:** Latest consumption sensors are no longer available, which may cause issues anywhere they are used.

### BREAKING CHANGES

* **api-client:** This change could cause the sensors associated with your meters to change, as they may have been
associated with a property you had moved out of
