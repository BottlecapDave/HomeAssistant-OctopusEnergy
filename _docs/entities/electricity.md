# Electricity

You'll get the following entities for each electricity meter with an active agreement.

## Current Rate

`sensor.octopus_energy_electricity_{{METER_SERIAL_NUMBER}}_{{MPAN_NUMBER}}_current_rate`

The current rate that energy consumption is charged at (including VAT).

This is in pounds and pence (e.g. 1.01 = £1.01).

!!! warning

    If you are on an intelligent tariff, then rate information will be adjusted to off-peak rates when a dispatch is discovered during the period. This off peak rate will be dependent on your car charging. As the integration has no knowledge of if your car is charging, this value might be incorrect. This is indicated via the `is_intelligent_adjusted` attribute.

## Smart Meter Entities

If your account information doesn't determine you have a smart meter, then you will have the following entities in a disabled state. If you enable these entities, they might not work correctly in this scenario.

If you are wishing to use these sensors with the Energy Dashboard, then you can follow this [guide](../setup/energy_dashboard.md).

> By default, it's not possible to include current consumption sensors. This is due to Octopus Energy only receive data from the smart meters up to the previous day. If you want current consumption, then you will need a [Octopus Home Mini](https://octopus.energy/blog/octopus-home-mini/).

### Previous Accumulative Consumption

`sensor.octopus_energy_electricity_{{METER_SERIAL_NUMBER}}_{{MPAN_NUMBER}}_previous_accumulative_consumption`

The total consumption reported by the meter for the previous day.

!!! info

    This retrieves the data reported directly by the meter which is used to calculate your bill. If you have an Octopus Home Mini (or similar), then data reported by this device will not be exposed in this sensor. This is to avoid confusion when comparing the data against your bill and to provide consistency between users with and without an Octopus Home Mini.

!!! warning

    This data won't necessarily be available at the stroke of midnight. This integration has no control of this and is at the mercy of when the data is available by Octopus Energy. 
    
    Because this sensor only looks at the previous day, if the data takes longer than 24 hours to populate then the sensor will not update. This can be determined by looking at the `data_last_retrieved` attribute which indicates when the data was last retrieved. For example, if the current day is 02/01/2024, it will look at data for 01/01/2024. If the data for 01/01/2024 doesn't populate until 03/01/2024 then the sensor will not update.

    If your data is always behind, you can adjust the number of days that the sensor looks back by [updating integrations config](../setup/account.md#previous-consumption-days-offset).

## Home Mini Entities

### Current Consumption

`sensor.octopus_energy_electricity_{{METER_SERIAL_NUMBER}}_{{MPAN_NUMBER}}_current_consumption`

    An export equivalent of this sensor does not exist because the data is not available

The latest electricity consumption sent to Octopus Energy. This will update every minute. This is a legacy sensor which was been built to see the accumulation within the energy dashboard. This _may_ be removed in the future.

It has been noticed that daily consumption reported in Home Assistant can differ to when looking at past data within Octopus Energy. It looks like this is because Octopus Energy will favour "official" data from your smart meter over the data they collect.

If current consumption data is unable to be retrieved, then the integration will attempt to retrieve missing data. This will be done for the current day only. This is due to it sharing the same data for the accumulation sensors and will not be changed.

#### Variants

The following variants of the [Current Accumulative Cost](#current-accumulative-cost) are available.

##### Off Peak

`sensor.octopus_energy_electricity_{{METER_SERIAL_NUMBER}}_{{MPAN_NUMBER}}_current_accumulative_cost_off_peak`

The total cost reported by the meter for the current day during off peak hours (the lowest available rate).

!!! note
    This is only available when on a tariff with 2 or 3 unique rates during a given day. 
    
    If you switch to a tariff that meets this criteria, you will need to reload the integration to gain access to this entity.

    If you switch to a tariff that no longer meets this criteria, the entity will no longer be updated. When you reload the integration, this entity will no longer be available.

    This is [disabled by default](../faq.md#there-are-entities-that-are-disabled-why-are-they-disabled-and-how-do-i-enable-them).

##### Standard

`sensor.octopus_energy_electricity_{{METER_SERIAL_NUMBER}}_{{MPAN_NUMBER}}_current_accumulative_cost_standard`

The total cost reported by the meter for the current day during standard hours (the middle rate).

!!! note
    This is only available when on a tariff with 2 or 3 unique rates during a given day. 
    
    If you switch to a tariff that meets this criteria, you will need to reload the integration to gain access to this entity.

    If you switch to a tariff that no longer meets this criteria, the entity will no longer be updated. When you reload the integration, this entity will no longer be available.

## Tariff Overrides

You may be on an existing tariff but want to know if the grass is greener (or cheaper) on the other side. The following entities are available in a disabled state, which when enabled can give you an indication what you'd be paying if you were on a different tariff and didn't change your energy habits.

See [below](#previous-accumulative-cost-override-tariff) for instructions on how to set up.

!!! info
    
    When updating the tariff depending on what previous consumption data is available, it can take up to 24 hours to update the cost. This will be improved in the future.

!!! warning

    This approach to tariff overrides has been marked as deprecated in favour of [tariff comparisons](../setup/tariff_comparison.md).

### Previous Accumulative Cost Override Tariff

`text.octopus_energy_electricity_{{METER_SERIAL_NUMBER}}_{{MPAN_NUMBER}}_previous_accumulative_cost_override_tariff`

This is used to define the electricity tariff you want to compare.

#### How To Use

Instructions on how to find tariffs can be found in the [faq](../faq.md#i-want-to-use-the-tariff-overrides-but-how-do-i-find-an-available-tariff).

Once you have found your target tariff

1. Click on this entity to open the info dialog.
2. Enter your tariff in the text box, and hit `enter` on your keyboard to confirm

!!! info

    When updating the tariff depending on what previous consumption data is available, it can take up to 24 hours to update the cost. This will be improved in the future.

### Previous Accumulative Cost Override

`sensor.octopus_energy_electricity_{{METER_SERIAL_NUMBER}}_{{MPAN_NUMBER}}_previous_accumulative_cost_override`

This is the cost of the previous electricity accumulation based on the specified tariff override.

For attributes, see [Previous Accumulative Cost](#previous-accumulative-cost).

### Previous Consumption Override Day Rates

`event.octopus_energy_electricity_{{METER_SERIAL_NUMBER}}_{{MPAN_NUMBER}}_previous_consumption_override_rates`

The state of this sensor states when the previous consumption override's rates were last updated. The attributes of this sensor exposes the previous consumption override's rates. 

!!! note
    This is [disabled by default](../faq.md#there-are-entities-that-are-disabled-why-are-they-disabled-and-how-do-i-enable-them).

| Attribute | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `rates` | `array` | The list of rates applicable for the previous consumption override |
| `tariff_code` | `string` | The tariff code associated with previous consumption override's rates |

Each rate item has the following attributes

| Attribute | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `start` | `datetime` | The date/time when the rate starts |
| `end` | `datetime` | The date/time when the rate ends |
| `value_inc_vat` | `float` | The value of the rate including VAT. This is in pounds and pence (e.g. 1.01 = £1.01) |
| `is_capped` | `boolean` | Indicates if the rate has been capped by a [configured price cap](../setup/account.md#pricing-caps) |
| `is_intelligent_adjusted` | `boolean` | Indicates if the rate has been adjusted due to a dispatch organised by an intelligent tariff |
