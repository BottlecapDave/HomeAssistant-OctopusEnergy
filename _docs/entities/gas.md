## Smart Meter Entities

If your account information doesn't determine you have a smart meter, then you will have the following entities in a disabled state. If you enable these entities, they might not work correctly in this scenario. 

If you are wishing to use these sensors with the Energy Dashboard, then you can follow this [guide](../setup/energy_dashboard.md).

> By default, it's not possible to include current consumption sensors. This is due to Octopus Energy only receive data from the smart meters up to the previous day.

### Previous Accumulative Consumption (m3)

`sensor.octopus_energy_gas_{{METER_SERIAL_NUMBER}}_{{MPRN_NUMBER}}_previous_accumulative_consumption_m3`

The total consumption reported by the meter for the previous day in m3. If your meter reports in m3, then this will be an accurate value reported by Octopus, otherwise it will be a calculated/estimated value.

!!! info

    This retrieves the data reported directly by the meter which is used to calculate your bill. If you have an Octopus Home Mini (or similar), then data reported by this device will not be exposed in this sensor. This is to avoid confusion when comparing the data against your bill and to provide consistency between users with and without an Octopus Home Mini.

!!! warning

    This data won't necessarily be available at the stroke of midnight. This integration has no control of this and is at the mercy of when the data is available by Octopus Energy. 
    
    Because this sensor only looks at the previous day, if the data takes longer than 24 hours to populate then the sensor will not update. This can be determined by looking at the `data_last_retrieved` attribute which indicates when the data was last retrieved. For example, if the current day is 02/01/2024, it will look at data for 01/01/2024. If the data for 01/01/2024 doesn't populate until 03/01/2024 then the sensor will not update.

    If your data is always behind, you can adjust the number of days that the sensor looks back by [updating integrations config](../setup/account.md#previous-consumption-days-offset).

| Attribute | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `mprn` | `string` | The mprn for the associated meter |
| `serial_number` | `string` | The serial for the associated meter |
| `is_estimated` | `boolean` | Determines if the consumption was estimated. This can occur if your meter reports in `kwh`. |
| `total_kwh` | `float` | The total energy value for the previous day in `kwh`. If your meter reports in `m3`, then this will be estimated using your set [calorific value](../setup/account.md#calorific-value) |
| `total_m3` | `float` | The total energy value for the previous day in `m3`. If your meter reports in `kwh`, then this will be estimated using your set [calorific value](../setup/account.md#calorific-value) |
| `last_evaluated` | `datetime` | The timestamp determining when the consumption was last calculated. |
| `charges` | `array` | Collection of consumption periods for the previous day broken down into 30 minute periods. |

### Previous Accumulative Consumption (kWh)

`sensor.octopus_energy_gas_{{METER_SERIAL_NUMBER}}_{{MPRN_NUMBER}}_previous_accumulative_consumption_kwh`

The total consumption reported by the meter for the previous day in kwh. If your meter reports in kwh, then this will be an accurate value reported by Octopus, otherwise it will be a calculated/estimated value.

!!! info

    This retrieves the data reported directly by the meter which is used to calculate your bill. If you have an Octopus Home Mini (or similar), then data reported by this device will not be exposed in this sensor. This is to avoid confusion when comparing the data against your bill and to provide consistency between users with and without an Octopus Home Mini.

!!! info

    This retrieves the data reported directly by the meter which is used to calculate your bill. If you have an Octopus Home Mini (or similar), then data reported by this device will not be exposed in this sensor. This is to avoid confusion when comparing the data against your bill and to provide consistency between users with and without an Octopus Home Mini.

    Because this sensor only looks at the previous day, if the data takes longer than 24 hours to populate then the sensor will not update. This can be determined by looking at the `data_last_retrieved` attribute which indicates when the data was last retrieved. For example, if the current day is 02/01/2024, it will look at data for 01/01/2024. If the data for 01/01/2024 doesn't populate until 03/01/2024 then the sensor will not update.

### Current Consumption

> This will only be available if you have specified you have a [Octopus Home Mini](../setup/account.md#home-mini). Do not set unless you have one

`sensor.octopus_energy_gas_{{METER_SERIAL_NUMBER}}_{{MPRN_NUMBER}}_current_consumption`

The latest gas consumption sent to Octopus Energy. By default, this will update every minute. This has been built to see the accumulation within the energy dashboard. If you are wanting a sensor to see the current day's accumulation, then you will need to use something like [utility meter](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/utility_meter/). It has been noticed that daily consumption reported in Home Assistant can differ to when looking at past data within Octopus Energy. It looks like this is because Octopus Energy will favour "official" data from your smart meter over the data they collect.

If current consumption data is unable to be retrieved, then the integration will attempt to retrieve missing data. This will be done up to 5 days behind to give a buffer before the API requires a higher interval and will not be changed.

## Tariff Overrides

You may be on an existing tariff but want to know if the grass is greener (or cheaper) on the other side. The following entities are available in a disabled state, which when enabled can give you an indication what you'd be paying if you were on a different tariff and didn't change your energy habits.

Instructions on how to find tariffs can be found in the [faq](../faq.md#i-want-to-use-the-tariff-overrides-but-how-do-i-find-an-available-tariff).

    When updating the tariff depending on what previous consumption data is available, it can take up to 24 hours to update the cost. This will be improved in the future.
