## Smart Meter Entities

If your account information doesn't determine you have a smart meter, then you will have the following entities in a disabled state. If you enable these entities, they might not work correctly in this scenario. 

If you are wishing to use these sensors with the Energy Dashboard, then you can follow this [guide](../setup/energy_dashboard.md).

> By default, it's not possible to include current consumption sensors. This is due to Octopus Energy only receive data from the smart meters up to the previous day.

### Previous Accumulative Consumption (m3)

`sensor.octopus_energy_gas_{{METER_SERIAL_NUMBER}}_{{MPRN_NUMBER}}_previous_accumulative_consumption_m3`

The total consumption reported by the meter (not other devices e.g. Home Mini) for the previous available full day in m3. If for example data is available up to `01:00` of `2024-09-02`, then this sensor will report the cost between `2024-09-01T00:00:00Z` and `2024-09-02T00:00:00Z`.

If your meter reports in m3, then this will be an accurate value reported by Octopus, otherwise it will be a calculated/estimated value.

!!! info

    This retrieves the data reported directly by the meter which is used to calculate your bill. If you have an Octopus Home Mini (or similar), then data reported by this device will not be exposed in this sensor. This is to avoid confusion when comparing the data against your bill and to provide consistency between users with and without an Octopus Home Mini.

!!! warning

    This data won't necessarily be available at the stroke of midnight. This integration has no control of this and is at the mercy of when the data is available by Octopus Energy. 
    
    Because this sensor only looks at the last complete day, if the data takes longer than 24 hours to populate then the sensor will not update straight away. You can look at the [data_last_retrieved sensor](./diagnostics.md#previous-consumption-and-rates-data-last-retrieved) which indicates when the data was last retrieved.

| Attribute | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `mprn` | `string` | The mprn for the associated meter |
| `serial_number` | `string` | The serial for the associated meter |
| `is_estimated` | `boolean` | Determines if the consumption was estimated. This can occur if your meter reports in `kwh`. |
| `total_kwh` | `float` | The total energy value for the previous day in `kwh`. If your meter reports in `m3`, then this will be estimated using your set [calorific value](../setup/account.md#calorific-value) |
| `total_m3` | `float` | The total energy value for the previous day in `m3`. If your meter reports in `kwh`, then this will be estimated using your set [calorific value](../setup/account.md#calorific-value) |
| `charges` | `array` | Collection of consumption periods for the previous day broken down into 30 minute periods. |
| `calorific_value` | `float` | The calorific value used for the calculations, as set in your [account](../setup/account.md#calorific-value). |

### Previous Accumulative Consumption (kWh)

`sensor.octopus_energy_gas_{{METER_SERIAL_NUMBER}}_{{MPRN_NUMBER}}_previous_accumulative_consumption_kwh`

If your meter reports in kwh, then this will be an accurate value reported by Octopus, otherwise it will be a calculated/estimated value.

## Home Mini/Pro Entities

### Current Consumption

`sensor.octopus_energy_gas_{{METER_SERIAL_NUMBER}}_{{MPRN_NUMBER}}_current_consumption`

!!! warning
    This will only be available if you have specified you have an [Octopus Home Mini](../setup/account.md#home-mini). Do not set unless you have one.

The latest gas consumption sent to Octopus Energy. By default, this will update every minute. This has been built to see the accumulation within the energy dashboard. If you are wanting a sensor to see the current day's accumulation, then you will need to use something like [utility meter](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/utility_meter/). It has been noticed that daily consumption reported in Home Assistant can differ to when looking at past data within Octopus Energy. It looks like this is because Octopus Energy will favour "official" data from your smart meter over the data they collect.

If current consumption data is unable to be retrieved, then the integration will attempt to retrieve missing data. This will be done up to 5 days behind to give a buffer before the API requires a higher interval and will not be changed.
