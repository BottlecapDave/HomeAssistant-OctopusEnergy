The following events are raised by the integration. These events power various sensors mentioned above. They can also be used to trigger automations. An example automation might look like the following

```yaml
- alias: OE rates change
  trigger:
  - platform: event
    event_type: octopus_energy_electricity_next_day_rates
  condition: []
  action:
  - event: notify_channels
    event_data_template:
      mode: message
      title: OE price changes
      message: >
        New rates available for {{ trigger.event.data.mpan }}. Starting value is {{ trigger.event.data.rates[0]["value_inc_vat"] }}
      target: <@ULU7111GU>
