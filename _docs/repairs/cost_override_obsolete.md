# Repairs - Cost override deprecated

If you receive this fixable warning, it means that you are using the cost tariff override sensors. These default sensors are going away in favour of opting in via the integrations page.

To fix
1. Navigate to your cost tariff override sensors and reset the tariff to your current tariff (this will remove the repair warning)
2. Follow the [tariff comparison instructions](../setup/tariff_comparison.md) to setup the new entities that replace these entities.
