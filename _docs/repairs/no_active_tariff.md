# Repairs - No active tariff

If you receive this repair notice it means that no active tariff was found for one or more of your meters. There are a few reasons why this might be the case.

1. You are in the middle of switching tariffs. There can sometimes be a gap in your tariff information coming through when your existing tariff ends and your new tariff begins.
2. You are new to OE and your tariff hasn't begun yet. Once your tariff starts, the integration will pick it up and should start working.
3. There is a configuration issue with your account. In this scenario, you'll need to contact Octopus Energy support to get this rectified.

All of the above scenarios can be confirmed within your [diagnostic data](../faq.md#ive-been-asked-for-my-meter-information-in-a-bug-request-how-do-i-obtain-this). This will contain your account data including your meters. Under each of your meters, you'll have a list of tariff agreements. For each meter, you should have an agreement with a start date in the past and an end date either in the future or with no end date.
