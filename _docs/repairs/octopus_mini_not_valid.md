# Repairs - Octopus Mini not valid

If you receive this warning, then it is because you have configured the integration to have Octopus Mini enabled, but one or more of your sensors do not have the details available for your Octopus Mini.

This could be perfectly valid for one of your meters (e.g. one of your meters isn't available via Octopus Mini), in which case you can ignore the repair notice. If this is not the case, then you should either

1. Update the config of your specified account and turn off [Octopus Mini support](../setup/account.md#home-mini) or 
2. You should raise an issue with Octopus Energy stating the data isn't coming through your account data.
