# Repairs - Unknown intelligent provider

Not all intelligent providers are created equally, so each provider needs to be manually configured around what features are available. For example, `OHME` doesn't have bump charging enabled as it's all managed by `OHME` instead of Octopus Energy.

Please [raise a support issue](https://github.com/BottlecapDave/HomeAssistant-OctopusEnergy/issues) as an `Unknown intelligent provider` to fix this repair notice and potentially enable more functionality for your intelligent provider.
