# Repairs - Unknown intelligent provider

Not all intelligent providers are created equally, so each provider needs to be manually configured around what features are available. For example, `OHME` doesn't have bump charging enabled as it's all managed by `OHME` instead of Octopus Energy.

Please first update to the latest version of the integration as the provider might be supported in a newer version. 

If it's still not available, check to see if anyone else has already [raised a support issue](https://github.com/BottlecapDave/HomeAssistant-OctopusEnergy/issues). 

If no one else has raised an issue around the unknown intelligent provider, then [raise a support issue](https://github.com/BottlecapDave/HomeAssistant-OctopusEnergy/issues) as an `Unknown intelligent provider` to fix this repair notice and potentially enable more functionality for your intelligent provider.
