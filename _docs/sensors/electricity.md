## Smart Meter Sensors

If your account information doesn't determine you have a smart meter, then you will have the following sensors in a disabled state. If you enable these sensors, they might not work correctly in this scenario.

If you are wishing to use these sensors with the Energy Dashboard, then you can follow this [guide](../energy_dashboard.md).

> By default, it's not possible to include current consumption sensors. This is due to Octopus Energy only receive data from the smart meters up to the previous day. If you want current consumption, then you will need a [Octopus Home Mini](https://octopus.energy/blog/octopus-home-mini/).

The latest electricity consumption sent to Octopus Energy. This will update every minute. This is a legacy sensor which was been built to see the accumulation within the energy dashboard. This _may_ be removed in the future.

It has been noticed that daily consumption reported in Home Assistant can differ to when looking at past data within Octopus Energy. It looks like this is because Octopus Energy will favour "official" data from your smart meter over the data they collect.

If current consumption data is unable to be retrieved, then the integration will attempt to retrieve missing data. This will be done for the current day only. This is due to it sharing the same data for the accumulation sensors and will not be changed.

## Tariff Overrides

You may be on an existing tariff but want to know if the grass is greener (or cheaper) on the other side. The following entities are available in a disabled state, which when enabled can give you an indication what you'd be paying if you were on a different tariff and didn't change your energy habits.

See [below](#previous-accumulative-cost-override-tariff-electricity) for instructions on how to set up.

> Please note: When updating the tariff depending on what previous consumption data is available, it can take up to 24 hours to update the cost. This will be improved in the future.

### Previous Accumulative Cost Override Tariff

`text.octopus_energy_electricity_{{METER_SERIAL_NUMBER}}_{{MPAN_NUMBER}}_previous_accumulative_cost_override_tariff`

#### How To Use

Instructions on how to find tariffs can be found in the [faq](../faq.md#i-want-to-use-the-tariff-overrides-but-how-do-i-find-an-available-tariff).

Once you have found your target tariff

1. Click on this entity to open the info dialog.
2. Enter your tariff in the text box, and hit `enter` on your keyboard to confirm
