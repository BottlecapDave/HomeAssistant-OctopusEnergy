## Smart Meter Sensors

If your account information doesn't determine you have a smart meter, then you will have the following sensors in a disabled state. If you enable these sensors, they might not work correctly in this scenario. 

If you are wishing to use these sensors with the Energy Dashboard, then you can follow this [guide](../energy_dashboard.md).

> By default, it's not possible to include current consumption sensors. This is due to Octopus Energy only receive data from the smart meters up to the previous day.

> Please note that this data won't necessarily be available at the stroke of midnight and has been reported to take up to 18 hours for it to appear. This integration has no control of this and is at the mercy of when the data is available by Octopus Energy. If data is not available within the 24 hour timeframe, then the integration will not be able to pick up and display the data.

## Home Mini Sensors

### Current Consumption

> This will only be available if you have specified you have a [Octopus Home Mini](../setup_account.md#home-mini). Do not set unless you have one

`sensor.octopus_energy_gas_{{METER_SERIAL_NUMBER}}_{{MPRN_NUMBER}}_current_consumption`

The latest gas consumption sent to Octopus Energy. By default, this will update every minute. This has been built to see the accumulation within the energy dashboard. If you are wanting a sensor to see the current day's accumulation, then you will need to use something like [utility meter](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/utility_meter/). It has been noticed that daily consumption reported in Home Assistant can differ to when looking at past data within Octopus Energy. It looks like this is because Octopus Energy will favour "official" data from your smart meter over the data they collect.

If current consumption data is unable to be retrieved, then the integration will attempt to retrieve missing data. This will be done up to 5 days behind to give a buffer before the API requires a higher interval and will not be changed.

|-----------|------|-------------|
| `mprn` | `string` | The mprn for the associated meter |
| `serial_number` | `string` | The serial for the associated meter |

| `charges` | `array` | Collection of consumption periods for the previous day broken down into 30 minute periods. |

## Tariff Overrides

You may be on an existing tariff but want to know if the grass is greener (or cheaper) on the other side. The following entities are available in a disabled state, which when enabled can give you an indication what you'd be paying if you were on a different tariff and didn't change your energy habits.

Instructions on how to find tariffs can be found in the [faq](../faq.md#i-want-to-use-the-tariff-overrides-but-how-do-i-find-an-available-tariff).

> Please note: When updating the tariff depending on what previous consumption data is available, it can take up to 24 hours to update the cost. This will be improved in the future.

### Previous Accumulative Cost Override Tariff

`text.octopus_energy_gas_{{METER_SERIAL_NUMBER}}_{{MPRN_NUMBER}}_previous_accumulative_cost_override_tariff`

This is used to define the gas tariff you want to compare

#### How To Use

Instructions on how to find tariffs can be found in the [faq](../faq.md#i-want-to-use-the-tariff-overrides-but-how-do-i-find-an-available-tariff).

Once you have found your target tariff

1. Click on this entity to open the info dialog.
2. Enter your tariff in the text box, and hit `enter` on your keyboard to confirm

> Please note: When updating the tariff depending on what previous consumption data is available, it can take up to 24 hours to update the cost. This will be improved in the future.
