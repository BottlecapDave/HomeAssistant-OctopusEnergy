# Account

Setup is done entirely via the [integration UI](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=octopus_energy).

## Home Mini

If you are lucky enough to own an [Octopus Home Mini](https://octopus.energy/blog/octopus-home-mini/), you can now receive this data within Home Assistant. When setting up (or editing) your account within Home Assistant, you will need to check the box next to `I have a Home Mini`. This will gain the following entities which can be added to the [energy dashboard](https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2021/08/04/home-energy-management/):

!!! info

    You will only have the same data exposed in the integration that is available within the app. There has been reports of gas not appearing within the app (and integration) straight away, so you might have to wait a few days for this to appear. Once it's available within the app, if you reload the integration (or restart Home Assistant) then the entities should become available.

!!! warning

    Export sensors are not provided as the data is not available

See [electricity entities](../entities/electricity.md#home-minipro-entities) and [gas entities](../entities/gas.md#home-minipro-entities) for more information.

### Refresh Rate In Minutes

This determines how often data related to your Home Mini is retrieved from Octopus Energy. The Octopus Energy APIs have a rate limit of 100 calls per hour, which is shared among all calls including through the app. The defaults are usually enough for one electricity and one gas meter's data to be retrieved. However, if you are using other integrations, have more meters being tracked or want the app to not be effected you may want to increase this rate.

You can adjust these independently between gas and electricity.

## Calorific Value

When calculating gas costs, a calorific value is included in the calculation. Unfortunately this changes from region to region and is not provided by the Octopus Energy API. The default value of this is `40`, but if you check your latest bill you should be able to find the value for you. This will give you a more accurate consumption and cost calculation when your meter reports in `m3`.

!!! info

    Changing this will change future calculations. It will not change calculations that have been made in the past.

## Pricing Caps

There has been inconsistencies across tariffs on whether government pricing caps are included or not. Therefore the ability to configure pricing caps has been added within you account. This is configured in pounds and pence format (e.g. 0.12 for 12p).

!!! info

    While rates are reflected straight away, consumption based sensors may take up to 24 hours to reflect. This is due to how they look at data and cannot be changed.

## Favour direct debit rates

There are some tariffs where direct debit and non direct debit rates are available. This toggle determines which rate to use in these situations.


!!! info

    It might take a couple of minutes for these changes to reflect once changed.

## Manually refresh intelligent dispatches

By default, intelligent dispatches are retrieved [periodically](../faq.md#how-often-is-data-refreshed). This is fine for most scenarios, but this can be a little slow depending on what else you're doing off the back of the dispatches. If you have other ways of knowing when new dispatches should be available (e.g. your charger changes to a charging state or a manual button in your HA dashboard), then you can turn on `Manually refresh intelligent dispatches`. This will disable the periodic refreshing and expose a [service](../services.md#octopus_energyrefresh_intelligent_dispatches) which can be called to refresh the dispatches.

## Intelligent rates mode

If you are on an intelligent tariff then it's possible for you to get cheaper rates outside of your normal off peak periods if Octopus Energy schedules the charges and your car accepts the charges. The rate information provides by Octopus Energy doesn't take these periods into account, so the integration has to use the pending/completed dispatch information to adjust the rates appropriately. Due to the quality of the available data, this _can_ be off sometimes. This feature allows how the rate information is adjusted in these scenarios.

### Pending and completed dispatches will turn into off peak rates

This is the default behaviour. In this scenario, all pending dispatches will be assumed to be converted into successful off peak charges by the car and therefore all rates during these periods will be converted into the off peak rate. This will be indicated by the `is_intelligent_adjusted` property. This is useful when planning other devices to turn on in the future during these cheap periods (e.g. by using a [target rate sensor](./target_rate.md)). 

!!! warning

    One side effect of this is around cost sensors, where if a pending dispatch does not turn into a completed dispatch, the cost sensor can increase in value when the pending dispatch is removed.

### Only completed dispatches will turn into off peak rates

In this scenario only completed dispatches will be taken into account for adjustments meaning all rates during only completed dispatch periods will be converted into the off peak rate. This will be indicated by the `is_intelligent_adjusted` property. This means no future planning can be made to take advantage of these cheap periods by rates alone.

!!! warning

    One side effect of this is around cost sensors, where when a completed dispatch arrives the cost sensor will decrease in value.

    There have also been reports of some successful charges not resolving into completed dispatches.

## Home Pro

If you are lucky enough to own an [Octopus Home Pro](https://forum.octopus.energy/t/for-the-pro-user/8453/2352/), you can now receive this data locally from within Home Assistant. 

!!! warning

    Integrating with the Octopus Home Pro is currently experimental. Use at your own risk.

### Prerequisites

!!! info

    The Octopus Home Pro has a local API which is used to get consumption and demand data. If this is all you need, then you can jump straight to the [settings](./account.md#settings).

However, there is also an internal API for setting the display which is not currently exposed. In order to make this available for consumption by this integration you will need to expose a custom API on your device by following the instructions below

!!! warning

    This custom API can only be configured with the default Home Pro setup. If you set up Home Assistant on your Home Pro device, then it won't be possible to expose this custom API.

1. Follow [the instructions](https://github.com/OctopusSmartEnergy/Home-Pro-SDK-Public/blob/main/Home.md#sdk) to connect to your Octopus Home Pro via SSH
2. Run the command `wget -O setup_ha.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BottlecapDave/HomeAssistant-OctopusEnergy/main/home_pro_server/setup.sh` to download the installation script
3. Run the command `chmod +x setup_ha.sh` to make the script executable
4. Run the command `./setup_ha.sh` to run the installation script
5. Edit `startup.sh` and add the following **before** the line `# Start the ssh server`

```
export SERVER_AUTH_TOKEN=thisisasecrettoken # Replace with your own unique string. This can be anything you wish. 
(cd /root/bottlecapdave_homeassistant_octopus_energy && ./start_server.sh)
```

At the time of writing, your `startup.sh` should now look _something_ like the following

```
#!/bin/bash

# Ensure our main env shows up in ssh sessions
# we're passing on API host info
env | grep _ >> /etc/environment

export SERVER_AUTH_TOKEN=thisisasecrettoken # Replace with your own unique string. This can be anything you wish.
(cd /root/bottlecapdave_homeassistant_octopus_energy && ./start_server.sh)

# Start the ssh server
/usr/sbin/sshd -D
```

Once saved, restart your Octopus Home Pro to boot up the custom API on start.

### Settings

Once the API has been configured, you will need to set the address to the IP address of your Octopus Home Pro (e.g. `http://192.168.1.2`).

**If you have setup the custom API**, then you will need to set api key to the value you set `SERVER_AUTH_TOKEN` to.
