After you've configured your [account](./setup_account.md), you'll be able to configure target rate sensors. These are configured by adding subsequent instances of the integration going through the [normal flow](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=octopus_energy).

These sensors calculate the lowest continuous or intermittent rates **within a 24 hour period** and turn on when these periods are active. If you are targeting an export meter, then the sensors will calculate the highest continuous or intermittent rates **within a 24 hour period** and turn on when these periods are active.

These sensors can then be used in automations to turn on/off devices that save you (and the planet) energy and money. You can go through this flow as many times as you need target rate sensors.

Each sensor will be in the form `binary_sensor.octopus_energy_target_{{TARGET_RATE_NAME}}`.

## From and To times

If you're wanting your devices to come on during a certain period, for example while you're at work, you can set the minimum and/or maximum times for your target rate sensor. These are specified in 24 hour clock format and will attempt to find the optimum discovered period during these times.

If not specified, these default from `00:00:00` to `23:59:59`. However you can use this feature to change this evaluation period. 

If for example you want to look at prices overnight you could set your from time to something like `20:00` and your `to` time to something like `05:00`. If you're wanting to "shift" the evaluation period to be in line with something (e.g. agile pricing), you could set your `from` and `to` to something like `16:00`.

See the examples below for how this might work.

## Hours

The hours that you require for the sensor to find. This should be in decimal format and represent 30 minute increments. For example 30 minutes would be `0.5`, 1 hour would be `1` or `1.0`, 1 hour and 30 minutes would be `1.5`, etc.

## Offset

You may want your target rate sensors to turn on a period of time before the optimum discovered period. For example, you may be turning on a robot vacuum cleaner for a 30 minute clean and want it to charge during the optimum period. For this, you'd use the `offset` field and set it to `-00:30:00`, which can be both positive and negative and go up to a maximum of 24 hours. This will shift when the sensor turns on relative to the optimum period. For example, if the optimum period is between `2023-01-18T10:00` and `2023-01-18T11:00` with an offset of `-00:30:00`, the sensor will turn on between `2023-01-18T09:30` and `2023-01-18T10:30`.

## Rolling Target

Depending on how you're going to use the sensor, you might want the best period to be found throughout the day so it's always applicable. For example, you might be using the sensor to turn on a washing machine which you might want to come on at the best time regardless of when you use the washing machine.

However, you might also only want the target time to occur once a day so once the best time for that day has passed it won't turn on again. For example, you might be using the sensor to turn on something that isn't time critical and could wait till the next day like a charger.

This feature is toggled on by the `Re-evaluate multiple times a day` checkbox.

## Latest Period

Depending on how you're going to use the sensor, you might want the best period at the latest possible time. For example, you might be using the sensor to turn on an emersion heater which you'll want to come on at the end of the cheap period. 

For instance if you turn this on, the cheapest period is between `2023-01-01T00:30` and `2023-01-01T05:00` and your target rate is for 1 hour, then it will come on between `2023-01-01T04:00` and `2023-01-01T05:00` instead of `2023-01-01T00:30` and `2023-01-01T01:30`.

This feature is toggled on by the `Find latest applicable dates` checkbox.

## Examples

Lets look at a few examples. Lets say we have the the following (unrealistic) set of rates

| start | end | value |
| ----- | --- | ----- |
| `2023-01-01T00:00` | `2023-01-01T00:30` | 6 |
| `2023-01-01T00:30` | `2023-01-01T05:00` | 12 |
| `2023-01-01T05:00` | `2023-01-01T05:30` | 7 |
| `2023-01-01T05:30` | `2023-01-01T18:00` | 20 |
| `2023-01-01T18:00` | `2023-01-01T23:30` | 34 |
| `2023-01-01T23:30` | `2023-01-02T00:30` | 5 |
| `2023-01-02T00:30` | `2023-01-02T05:00` | 12 |
| `2023-01-02T05:00` | `2023-01-02T05:30` | 7 |
| `2023-01-02T05:30` | `2023-01-02T18:00` | 20 |
| `2023-01-02T18:00` | `2023-01-02T23:00` | 34 |
| `2023-01-02T23:30` | `2023-01-03T00:00` | 6 |

### Continuous

If we look at a continuous sensor that we want on for 1 hour.

If we set no from/to times, then our 24 hour period being looked at ranges from `00:00:00` to `23:59:59`.

The following table shows what this would be like.

| current date/time  | period                                | `Re-evaluate multiple times a day` | reasoning |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------- |
| `2023-01-01T00:00` | `2023-01-01T00:00` - `2023-01-01T01:00` | `false`                            | while 5 is our lowest rate within the current 24 hour period, it doesn't cover our whole 1 hour and is next to a high 34 rate. A rate of 6 is the next available rate with a low following rate. |
| `2023-01-01T01:00` | `2023-01-02T00:00` - `2023-01-02T01:00` | `false`                            | Our lowest period is in the past, so we have to wait until our target period has passed to look at the next evaluation period. |
| `2023-01-01T01:00` | `2023-01-01T04:30` - `2023-01-01T05:30` | `true`                             | The rate of 6 is in the past, so 7 is our next lowest rate. 12 is smaller rate than 20 so we start in the rate period before to fill our desired hour. |
| `2023-01-01T23:30` | None | `true`                             | There is no longer enough time available in the current 24 hour period, so we have to wait until our target period has passed to look at the next evaluation period. |

If we set our from/to times for `05:00` to `19:00`, we then limit the period that we look at. The following table shows what this would be like.

| current date/time  | period                                | `Re-evaluate multiple times a day` | reasoning |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------- |
| `2023-01-01T00:00` | `2023-01-01T05:00` - `2023-01-01T06:00` | `false`                            | The rate of 12 is no longer available as it's outside of our `from` time. |
| `2023-01-01T06:30` | `2023-01-02T05:00` - `2023-01-02T06:00` | `false`                            | Our lowest period is in the past, so we have to wait until our target period has passed to look at the next evaluation period. |
| `2023-01-01T06:30` | `2023-01-01T06:30` - `2023-01-01T07:30` | `true`                             | The rate of 7 is in the past, so we must look for the next lowest combined rate |
| `2023-01-01T18:00` | `2023-01-01T18:00` - `2023-01-01T19:00` | `true`                             | The rate of 20 is in the past, so we must look for the next lowest combined rate which is 34 |
| `2023-01-01T18:30` | None | `true`                            | There is no longer enough time available within our restricted time, so we have to wait until our target period has passed to look at the next evaluation period. |

If we set our from/to times to look over two days, from `20:00` to `06:00`, we then limit the period that we look at to overnight. The following table shows what this would be like.

| current date/time  | period                                | `Re-evaluate multiple times a day` | reasoning |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------- |
| `2023-01-01T20:00` | `2023-01-01T23:30` - `2023-01-02T01:30` | `false`                            | Our lowest rate of 5 now falls between our overnight time period so is available |
| `2023-01-02T02:00` | `2023-01-01T23:30` - `2023-01-02T01:30` | `false`                            | Our lowest period is in the past, so we have to wait until our target period has passed to look at the next evaluation period. |
| `2023-01-02T02:00` | `2023-01-02T04:30` - `2023-01-02T05:30` | `true`                             | The rate of 5 is in the past, so we must look for the next lowest combined rate, which includes our half hour rate at 7 |
| `2023-01-02T05:30` | None | `true`                             | There is no longer enough time available within our restricted time, so we have to wait until our target period has passed to look at the next evaluation period. |

If we set an offset of `-00:30:00`, then while the times might be the same, the target rate sensor will turn on 30 minutes before the select rate period starts. Any set time restrictions **will not** include the offset.

### Intermittent

If we look at an intermittent sensor that we want on for 1 hour total (but not necessarily together).

If we set no from/to times, then our 24 hour period being looked at ranges from `00:00:00` to `23:59:59`.

The following table shows what this would be like.

| current date/time  | period                                | `Re-evaluate multiple times a day` | reasoning |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------- |
| `2023-01-01T00:00` | `2023-01-01T00:00` - `2023-01-01T00:30`, `2023-01-01T23:30` - `2023-01-02T00:00` | `false`                            | Our sensor will go on for 30 minutes at the cheapest rate, then 30 minutes at the next cheapest rate. |
| `2023-01-01T01:00` | `2023-01-01T00:00` - `2023-01-01T00:30`, `2023-01-01T23:30` - `2023-01-02T00:00` | `false`                            | Our sensor will go on for 30 minutes at the cheapest rate, which will be in the past, then 30 minutes at the next cheapest rate. |
| `2023-01-01T01:00` | `2023-01-01T05:00` - `2023-01-01T05:30`, `2023-01-01T23:30` - `2023-01-02T00:00` | `true`                             | Our sensor will go on for 30 minutes at the second cheapest rate, then 30 minutes at the third cheapest rate. |
| `2023-01-01T23:30` | None | `true`                             | There is no longer enough time available in the current 24 hour period, so we have to wait until our target period has passed to look at the next evaluation period. |

If we set our from/to times for `05:00` to `19:00`, we then limit the period that we look at. The following table shows what this would be like.

| current date/time  | period                                | `Re-evaluate multiple times a day` | reasoning |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------- |
| `2023-01-01T00:00` | `2023-01-01T05:00` - `2023-01-01T05:30`, `2023-01-01T05:30` - `2023-01-01T06:00` | `false`                            | Our cheapest rates are outside our target range, so we need to look at the next cheapest. Luckily on our scenario the two cheapest rates are next to each other. |
| `2023-01-01T06:30` | `2023-01-01T05:00` - `2023-01-01T05:30`, `2023-01-01T05:30` - `2023-01-01T06:00` | `false`                            | Both of our cheapest rates in the target range are in the past. |
| `2023-01-01T06:30` | `2023-01-01T06:30` - `2023-01-01T07:00`, `2023-01-01T07:00` - `2023-01-01T07:30` | `true`                             | Both of our cheapest rates in the target range are in the past, so we must look for the next lowest combined rate |
| `2023-01-01T18:30` | None | `true`                            | There is no longer enough time available within our restricted time, so we have to wait until our target period has passed to look at the next evaluation period. |

If we set our from/to times to look over two days, from `20:00` to `06:00`, we then limit the period that we look at to overnight. The following table shows what this would be like.

| current date/time  | period                                | `Re-evaluate multiple times a day` | reasoning |

| `2023-01-02T02:00` | `2023-01-02T02:00` - `2023-01-02T02:30`, `2023-01-02T05:00` - `2023-01-02T05:30` | `true`                             | The rate of 5 is in the past, so we must look for the next lowest combined rate, which includes our half hour rate at 7 |
| `2023-01-02T05:30` | None | `true`                             | There is no longer enough time available within our restricted time, so we have to wait until our target period has passed to look at the next evaluation period. |

If we set an offset of `-00:30:00`, then while the times might be the same, the target rate sensor will turn on 30 minutes before the select rate period starts. Any set time restrictions **will not** include the offset.
